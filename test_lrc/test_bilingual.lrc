[00:25.80]故事的小黄花 / The little yellow flowers of the story
[00:29.10]从出生那年就飘着 / Have been floating since the year I was born
[00:32.40]童年的荡秋千 / The childhood swing
[00:35.70]随记忆一直晃到现在 / Keeps swinging with my memories until now
[00:39.00]Re So So Si Do Si La
[00:42.30]So La Si Si Si Si La Si La So
[00:45.60]吹着前奏望着天空 / Whistling the prelude while looking at the sky
[00:48.90]我想起花瓣试着掉落 / I recall the flower petals trying to fall
[00:52.20]为你翘课的那一天 / The day I skipped class for you
[00:55.50]花落的那一天 / The day the flowers fell
[00:58.80]教室的那一间 / That classroom
[01:02.10]我怎么看不见 / Why can't I see it
[01:05.40]消失的下雨天 / The disappeared rainy day
[01:08.70]我好想再淋一遍 / I really want to be soaked again
[01:12.00]没想到失去的勇气我还留着 / I didn't expect that I still have the courage I lost
[01:18.60]好想再问一遍 / I really want to ask again
[01:21.90]你会等待还是离开 / Will you wait or will you leave
[01:25.20]刮风这天我试过握着你手 / On this windy day I tried to hold your hand
[01:31.80]但偏偏雨渐渐大到我看你不见 / But the rain gradually became so heavy that I couldn't see you
[01:38.40]还要多久我才能在你身边 / How much longer until I can be by your side
[01:45.00]等到放晴的那天也许我会比较好一点 / Maybe I'll be a little better when the day clears up
[01:51.60]从前从前有个人爱你很久 / Once upon a time there was someone who loved you for a long time
[01:58.20]但偏偏风渐渐把距离吹得好远 / But the wind gradually blew the distance so far away
[02:04.80]好不容易又能再多爱一天 / It's not easy to be able to love for one more day
[02:11.40]但故事的最后你好像还是说了拜拜 / But at the end of the story you still seemed to say goodbye
